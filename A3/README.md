# Notes to the Marker:

Our team noticed that the Pokemon API was experiencing some issues on Friday, so we have left error message printing
to the terminal when an API call is unsuccessful for informative user feedback. Since we are providing this feedback
in the terminal, we do not reflect failed calls within the output text file or in the printed output to the console.
